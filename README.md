# Mock Landing Page
This project is meant to show some of the skills I have developed in HTML and CSS.
The landing page is for a nonexisting budget tracking application called **BreadSheet**

## Things To Know
- This page is a mockup so the links are not functional, but can easily be implemented into a useable project from this point. 
- This page was created using stock images
- This page was initially developed as a school project; however, the code in this repository was done soley by me

## Features
- Navbar
- Graphics used in a tandum with content on page
- Spacing and background color emphasize the page layout
- Code organization both within HTML and CSS allows for easy maintenance
